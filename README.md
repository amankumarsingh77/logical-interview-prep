# Logical Interview Prep

## Purpose

1. I failed an interview because I was not able to solve logical problems. So this repository will contain curated logical problems that I will be solving on a daily basis where the questions are generated by Gemini Gem.
2. Better understanding of Go programming language

## For Beginners

### New to Go?
This repository is an excellent starting point! Each problem is self-contained and demonstrates:
- Go syntax and idioms
- Error handling patterns
- Testing best practices
- Common data structures and algorithms

### Resources for Learning Go:
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) - Interactive introduction
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - Practical examples
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) - Best practices

### Not using Go?

No problem! The logical challenges are valuable in any language:

1. **Copy the problem statement** from `question.md`
2. **Paste it into your favorite AI assistant** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
3. **Ask for help understanding the question and requirements**
4. **Implement your own solution in your preferred language**

## Future Plans

- Go implementations (current focus)
- Potentially expand to other languages based on needs
- Add difficulty categorization
- Tag problems by topic/skill area
- Create progress tracking system

## Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but feel free to:
- **Star** if you find it helpful
- **Fork** to create your own version
- **Share** with others preparing for interviews
- **Suggest** improvements or new problem ideas

**Happy Coding!** Remember, the goal isn't just to solve problemsâ€”it's to understand the thinking process behind each solution.
